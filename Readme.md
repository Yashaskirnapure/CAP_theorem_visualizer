# CAP Theorem Visualizer

An educational tool (**work in progress**) designed to demonstrate the **CAP theorem** using a **Node.js server** and a locally running **Apache Cassandra cluster** via **Docker Compose**. The goal is to let users interact with a simulated distributed environment in real time â€” adjusting database settings and network conditions to see CAP trade-offs in action.

## Goals
- Configure **Cassandra consistency levels** (`ONE`, `QUORUM`, `ALL`) for reads and writes.
- Simulate **network partitions** by disabling or isolating nodes.
- Observe the impact on **data staleness** and **node availability**.
- All components run **locally**, making experimentation easy and self-contained.
